# Map Locations Game

This is a game I made inspired by Sporcle & cityquiz.io. 

I initially made a version of the game build with HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript. You can play this version at https://s-vu.github.io/map-locations-game/. 

I am currently remaking a full-stack version of the game using Node.js, React, and Express. This version works and looks very similar to the plain version with some slight improvements.
