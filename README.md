# map-locations-game
Trivia game on a web browser inspired by Sporcle. Uses a map to display answers that user has listed already.

Has a version created with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, which is displayed on the Github pages for this repository.

Currently recreating the game with React & Express for back-end.
